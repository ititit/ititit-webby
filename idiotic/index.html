          <p>Experimentation and simulation reign in America’s desert Southwest. Consider Biosphere 2, Paolo Soleri’s Arcosanti, Joseph Smith’s Salt Lake City, Uber, Google, and Sun City, retirement community and progenitor of the golden years, or the 80-million-dollar 80,000-person smart city planned west of Phoenix, courtesy Bill Gates’s Cascade Investment. Phoenix, the region’s largest city, was always a simulation rendered atop the framework of an urban grid.</p>

<p>Yet, the simulation of Phoenix is glimpsed through God’s eye, betraying the city’s central hubristic conviction that we can plan antifragile complex systems from the top down. In a city hallmarked by the grid, striating the landscape with six-lane roads sprawling blocks one mile wide, punctuated by outcroppings of strip malls and dotted with palm trees and luxury highrises, the Valley of the Sun has become a token symbol for life out of balance. </p>

<img class = "img-fluid" src =" img/grid.png">

 <p>We are all Phoenicians; we who cling to VR, second lifers, chaos magicians … to dwell in the uncanny is to insist that it’s Phoenix all the way down, baby. As above, so below. We're caught not in an uncanny valley from which we can as an ascend, but circling an uncanny cul de sac.</p>

 <p>If we say that the Uncanny Valley is a test, what are we even supposed to be testing? Through simulation, we learn much more about our intuitions about humanity than we do about the nature of any particular cultural product itself; the uncanny valley is a mirror. To submit to the uncanny, to the nihilistic precession of simulacra, is to preclude the possibility of an outside and insist that it’s all a hall of mirrors. </p>


<img class = "img-fluid" src =" img/cul.png">


 <p>We need portals, not mirrors.  We need to experiment with activating lures for an outside, with modes of engaging the weird and the eerie: that which is out of place, should be but isn’t, shouldn’t be but is. Following Mark Fisher, the weird and eerie create portals between inside and outside but from the outside. </p>

 <p>So if another world is possible, how do we get there from here? What does it mean to “regain control” when we’re at one driver’s seat among millions?  We need to find a line of flight from within the Grid to without. Turn up, tune out, drop in: Take an idiotic approach. Seek the weird: “...it is a question of arraying oneself in an open space, of holding space, of maintaining the possibility of springing up at any point: the movement is not from one point to another, but becomes perpetual, without aim or destination, without arrival or departure.” </p>

John Locke wrote: “In the beginning, all was America.” Paraphrasing Serres: After a flood, the Eypgtian surveyors called harpedonaptai measured land, cordoning the washed world back into discrete slabs, demarcating property in the form of atoms of agriculture. And at once, hoisted by the state, law and geometry emerge under the banner of nature. The Leviathan gave us the first grid infrastructure; Hobbesian notions of property emerge as an entanglement of law and land backed by the state’s monopoly on violence.</p>

<p>Jefferson’s Land Ordinances of the 1780s began a century-long policy of parcelling out Western “frontier” land into six-mile square townships divided into thirty-six smaller one-mile lots to be bought from the government for development, dashing any hope of learning from a pre-Columbian land ethic with imperial, matrixial, lattice-based structures, presciently reflecting the more global use of the planning grid as part of the Western colonizer’s toolkit. </p>


<img class = "img-fluid" src =" img/phx.png">

<p>The surveyor's grid chunks space so to bring consistency to the inconsistent, wiping away the presuppositions to reveal the tabula rasa par excellence. Many overlook the hubris imbued by Phoenix’s name which intends to reference a modern city reborn of the pre-Columbian Hohokam people. As Phoenix’s narrative of rebirth erases indigenous presences and precludes narratives of indigenous futures, God’s eye erases the lived experience of the urban desert. </p>

<p>Not surprisingly, development in Phoenix took off after the second world war, as Americans were becoming acquainted with a new Wild West characterized by technicolor sunsets over the Hollywood Hills. In the 1930s, Phoenix stepped in with a different  Succulents, saguaro, Route 66, UFOs, Road Runner and TNT, shooting guns and chucking golf balls in the desert. Libertarian individualism or bourgeoisie consumerism? There’s no liberty here. </p>


<img class = "img-fluid" src =" img/vr.png">

<p>Thus, the grid is an abstraction operationalized as governing construct, a structure which binds together energies of oppression under the deceptive auspices of techno-rational objectivity that enable the state to handle both land and folk as simulation, as experiment. What else do off-gridders, van lifers, or preppers venture to escape but governance? To be governed is to be complicit in another’s simulation. With solar panels in tow, the new communalists cast off into the desert to start their own simulation, their own experiment.</p>

<p>But, there is no off the grid. The grid pervades Euclidean space, Cartesian space, Newtonian physics space, simulation space, or even video game space. In this sense, we could suggest that some contemporary modes of anti-capitalist, anti-authoritarian, anti-colonialist resistance do not attempt to escape the grid, but to refract, modulate, distort, transform and subvert grid logics.</p>

In the 1930s, tourist bureaus began calling Phoenix the Valley of the Sun, beckoning midwestern snowbirds to spend their golden years in synthetic suburban cities. Another legacy of the thirties was the automobile’s in-dash radio tuner, one of the few remaining traces of the golden age of radio. Moving through the Valley of the Sun, one finds oneself behind the wheel, in the driver’s seat, in the back of a ride share, but always in a car. Any other form of transit is an outlier.</p>

<p>
Driving down Southern or Apache in Tempe and Phoenix, one may turn on the radio and adjust the tuner of the AM radio to 530 KHz, to find not conservative talk radio or christian evangelism, but no stations broadcasting at all. At first one hears only the sound of radio atmospherics. One may break it off here to noodle towards some other station, disregarding the random static.</p>

<p>
But if there lingers any curiosity, listeners may be pulled into an-upside down, empowered by an imperative: turn information theory on its head; let noise become signal, signal become noise. </p>
<p>
What speaks is a radiophonic sonification of  fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. These fluctuations are caused by natural and anthropogenic electrical activities alike: lightning, semi-truck brakes. These frothing, pulsing, undulating sonorities pull one into the tide, beckoning one to surf along the infrastructure of the “infernal city of Phoenix,” to diagram serendipitous attunements to excesses and entropies of monstrous complexity in motion, amplifying otherwise tacit aberrations from the efficiency and control of managed urban infrastructures and ecosystems. </p>

In the wake of the signal/noise reversal undulates something eerie and electrifying: an outside. As day turns into night, rigid objects blur to gradient; likewise the radio makes no such distinction between outside and inside, environment and (automotive) body. Some sonorities can clearly be attributed to exterior phenomena (light rail power lines, neon signs, traffic lights). Others clearly emanate from processes interior to the car (wiper blades, headlights, AC, power steering). There are no clear lines between them; there are no discrete “notes.” The stability of presentational immediacy -- the reign of a reality appearing to us as individuated, discrete objects -- is thrown completely off-balance. </p>
<p>
No univocality, no interference, just heterogenesis.  </p>
<p>
In the midst of this weird radiophony, we encounter the Riemannian manifold inside Euclid’s box, the anarchy menacing the social contract, the sea from which the fish is plucked, the “nomos” enveloping the city, that unbordered place where ancient farmers let their animals graze.</p>
<p>
Beyond the pale, the rangeland. A desert or a steppe.</p>
<p>
In the midst of this weird, dynamic, and non-linear radiophony, driving along surface roads throughout urban Phoenix, two different modes emerge for listening in action and movement in thought:

Idiocy gets a bad rap. It’s important to consider idiocy a powerful technology for piercing the skin of an inside and letting outside flood in. Take as example Melville’s Bartelby the Scrivner. Sidestepping negation, Bartelby refuses refusal itself. He identifies an inside: wage labor, capitalistic economy, the legal system, etc. which exist as a set of self-justifying presuppositions which perpetuate themselves with ultimatums: yes or no. Such system has pre-prescribed actions to take in response to a dividual’s decision (if yes, then pay Bartelby his wage. If no, fire him). His non-response -- “I would prefer not to”  -- throws itself on the gears of the machine, breaks up the seamless and frictionless cohesion of the inside, allowing an ecstatic and exuberant outside to burst forth.

 <p>
We need more idiots. We need more idiotic technology. Idiocy is a technology for creating an interstice, a vacuum hastily absolved of its vacuity; A technical, social, and micropolitical decelerando. We need more idiots, and we need more modes of idiocy.  </p>
<p>
Jack Dorsey, co-founder and CEO of Twitter, recently disclosed in an interview that he spent time in an EMF-shielded tent (called “The Faraday”) in his garage.   </p>
<p>
Let’s clarify: Jack Dorsey is not an idiot. He is a moron.  </p>
<p>
Not because (we may assume) Dorsey believes that non-ionizing radiation from EMF is harmful. He is a moron because his refusal of technology, his apparent asceticism, is part and parcel of an atavistic subjectivity which fails (or, worse, is content never to attempt) to create a line of flight from within to without. Dorsey, in his mylar tent, creates a day-dream from which one may soon shake themselves free and go about running one of the internet’s four websites, feeding opportunist snake-oil salesmen free publicity so they may prey on sick or paranoid people. </p>
<p>
The idiot is not a moron, is not dumb, is not a jerk, is also not a Biblical fool. This is the difference drawn by Mark Fisher between the weird and the fantastic as exemplified Lovecraft and Tolkien: Tolkien builds worlds in which one finds themselves suddenly immersed; Lovecraft makes worlds which had entrances and exits.  </p>
<p>
Idiocy is a technology of resistance, a technology of refusing to play along, to halt the crowd from blinking at the same time and missing the lattices of power woven into the scaffolding of the worlds made for us. </p>
<p>
We believe we have already described the radio receiver in its great passivity as an organ of resonance under the rubric of idiotic technology.  </p>
<p>
And so the organ is ruptured and the outside flows in. What’s next?  </p>

Following Fisher and Lovecraft, we hold that pointing the way towards a portal to outside is an incomplete gesture, whose real exteriority requires other forces to actualize; we must enter, inhabit, occupy, cultivate, grow, and make.  </p>
<p>
That’s why the idiot alone is not enough. The word offers some clues. “Idiot” comes from “idio”, as in idiomatic, something of its own, something unique. Autistic or interior may come to mind here. In either case, it is only from a position of social of psychic exteriority that the idiot functions. In other words, we need an observer to describe the system, the intervention of idiocy, and the transformation of the system over time. We need second-order idiocy.  </p>
<p>
To get to other worlds, we need a kind of spaceship earth, masters’ tools pragmatism. We need to harness the given infrastructure which lends itself to the capture and regulation of energy. To escape a planet’s orbit we need to ride the planet’s gravity in order to slingshot the ship beyond. </p>

<p>
For us idiotic resonators, this means assuming the only perspective of import to planners aside from God’s eye: the automotive point of view, surfing along the infrastructural striations which are given to us in advance; a moving meditation for the embodied automotive mind. Walter Benjamin was among the flaneurs who ambled through Paris. Our mode of automotive and radiophonic movement affords a dynamic time warp of urban infrastructures, an attunement to the so-called “extensions of humankind”, which reveal radically more-than-human agencies animating that infrastructure.  </p>
<p>
Coupling with the car, we explore modes of embodiment usually ignored in somaesthetics and movement discourse. Traditionally embodiment refers to an attunement to diverse ways of knowing which disrupt mind/body dualisms and usurp  cognitivist understanding of human perception and action. Artists interested in aesthetics, aesthetic and movement have found embodiment discourses to elucidate aspects of felt experience otherwise eclipsed by strictly rational approaches. And yet, we find these conversations ultimately stunted by a reductionist dualism between organism and environment which situtates the embodied human mind as the chief mover shaking with the world. </p>
<p>
But take for example Mr. Ng from Neal Stephenson’s Snow Crash, a parapalegic who is surgically implanted inside a huge van. For Mr. Ng, it is not only about “extending” himself. It is also about a profound reorganization of movement and embodiment. In other words, we find ourselves reorganized by automotivity, and reorganized again by the electrical infrastructure of the city as mediated by radiophony. The organizational openness to non-human animation, the readiness to “go with the flow” is an idiocy of the second order, a “yes-and,” the sagacity to spot a seam. </p>

     <div class="col">
            <div class="row">

<p>To report on our experiences with this practice: we encounter sounds of a scale symphonic, dramatic, and dynamic. Cruising through the city we know from everyday with a renewed feeling of curiosity is deeply stirring and exciting, while our attunements to the radically foreign radiophonic soundscape creates a sense of tranquility. There is both the sense of near-horror at what looms as radically alien, and fascination with what does not seem to play by conventional rules.     </p>

<p>As a practice, reflecting now on these transmissions,  we find ourselves ethically imperilled, left with more questions than answers. Expelling carbon into the atmosphere, in a city which won’t exist as it does now in thirty years, driving in personal vehicles we shouldn’t need and, in so many ways, can’t afford, who are we to call ourselves second-order idiots, charged with taking lines of flight to the outside? You can make a portal, but you don’t have to step into it. And when should you step through the portal? And what about those who are stuck on the inside?     </p>
